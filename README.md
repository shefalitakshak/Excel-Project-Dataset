# Excel-Project- Bike Sales in Europe Dashboard
This is an end to end Excel Project.
In this Project I have used a dataset of Bike Sales in Europe with some other information like customer Id, Age, Commute distance and others.
Using the dataset I have created a dashboard of the Bike Sales of that dataset.
In which I first did Data Cleaning, then Data extraction and then finally Data Visualization by using Pivot Tables
and I have also provided slicers in order to know the relationship between the charts on the basis of the dataset used.
